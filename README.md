The datafile "hub25node.dat" contains Civil Aeronautics Board dataset of 25 nodes commonly used as a test instance for hub location problems. 
In the dataset, the first 25 x 25 matrix contains the demand between the 25 nodes, while the next 25 x 25 matrix contains the distances between the 25 nodes.
In the paper "An Exact Method for Trilevel Hub Location Problem with Interdiction" we generate experimental instances through varying these aspects: Weights, Co-efficient of transhipment, No. of hubs to locate, and No. of hubs to interdict
Weights (w_1,w_2) are varied in the following sets {(0.2, 0.8), (0.4, 0.6), (0.5,0.5), (0.6, 0.4), (0.8, 0.2)}
Co-efficient of transhipment is varied in the set {0.1, 0.5, 0.9}
No. of hubs to locate (p) is varied in the set {5, 10}
No. of hubs to interdict (r) is varied in the set {2,3,4} for p = 5; and (7,8,9) for p = 10.
